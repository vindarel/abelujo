Why AngularJS and not JQuery/Ember/<project xxx> ?
--------------------------------------------------

`AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`_ is a Model-View-Controller
framework to build dynamic user interfaces. It does double-data
binding at its core.

Angular isn't comparable with JQuery. See the basics: https://angularjs.org/#the-basics

Why not a simple library that does double data binding (like view.js)
? Because we will use all the power of Angular.

Ember has a similar scope. But besides technical details, it appears
we already have significant experience with Angular.
